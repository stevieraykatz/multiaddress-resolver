# ENSIP-XX: Multiaddress Resolution

## Abstract

This ENSIP specifies a new mechanism for associating multiple addresses with a single name. This should allow a user to collate their onchain identity within a single namespace.

## Motivation

Users leverage multiple wallets for many reaons but each wallet is just another facet of their onchain identity. With a Multiaddress resolver profile, users would have the option to associate any number of their active wallets with their identity.

This resolver extension also enables a critical step-change in how onchain primitives operate: Identity-based attestations, reputation, and builder activity are unlocked once signals are indexed against a namespace instead of a wallet address. 

## Specification

The field `addrs` is introduced which permits a set of EVM-compatible addresses to be supported by a single ENS name.

Two new accessor functions for resolvers are specified, the first for "default" `cointype == 60` behavior, and the second for more flexible ENSIP-11 compatible EVM network-as-cointype address mappings. 

```solidity
interface IMultiaddressResolver {
    function addrs(bytes32 node) external view returns (address[] memory);
    function addrs(bytes32 node, uint256 cointype) external view returns (address[] memory);
}
```

When called on a resolver, this function must return the EVM-compatible list of addresses stored for the specified namehash.

Two new events for resolvers are defined:

```solidity
event AddressesAdded(bytes32 indexed node, uint256 cointype, address[] addresses);

event AddressesRemoved(bytes32 indexed node, uint256 cointype, address[] addresses);
```

### Reverse Resolution

This specification is intended to be compatible with existing specifications for reverse resolution, specifically [ENSIP-19](https://docs.ens.domains/ensip/19). As of now, the set of addresses stored in the Addresses field are not to be confused with ["primary"](https://docs.ens.domains/web/reverse) names.
