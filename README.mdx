# ENSIP-XX: Multiaddress Resolution

## Abstract

This ENSIP specifies a new mechanism for associating multiple addresses with a single name. This should allow a user to collate their onchain identity within a single namespace.

## Motivation

This specification attempts to accomplish two primary goals: 1. remove the concept of addresses from the day-to-day experience of end-users and 2. make ENS identities the central hub for a user's captial-I Identity. 

More discretely, the primary motivations for multiaddress resolution are:
1. Onchain activity collation: all of the addresses a user associates with their name can be meaningfully and trustlessly attributed to them. This primitive unlocks true identity-based signals like reputation, builder score, and possibly paves the way towards credit. 
2. Portable identity across dApps: with multiaddress resolution, a user can connect one of their many associated wallets to an app and have their identity populated by leveraging multiaddress compatible reverse resolution. 
3. Name-based authentication patterns: dApps/contracts can start to leverage namespaces for auth in lieu of addresses, allowing a user to access permissioned methods with linked accounts in the multiaddress resolver. 
4. Recovery patterns: alongside the #3, recovery owners could be added to an identity space.
5. Compatibility with ephemeral smart contract wallets: there have been some discussions about leveraging scoped, ad-hoc SCWs for privacy-preserving payments and dApp-specific permissions. Both would result in a user having 10s or possibly 100s of accounts. Associating each of these with a parent identity via multiaddress unifies the onchain experience for the user (enabled by my point above about portability, #2).  

## Specification

The field `addrs` is introduced which permits a set of EVM-compatible addresses to be supported by a single ENS name.

Two new accessor functions for resolvers are specified, the first for "default" `cointype == 60` behavior, and the second for more flexible ENSIP-11 compatible EVM network-as-cointype address mappings. 

```solidity
interface IMultiaddressResolver {
    function addrs(bytes32 node) external view returns (address[] memory);
    function addrs(bytes32 node, uint256 cointype) external view returns (address[] memory);
}
```

When called on a resolver, this function must return the EVM-compatible list of addresses stored for the specified namehash.

Two new events for resolvers are defined:

```solidity
event AddressesAdded(bytes32 indexed node, uint256 cointype, address[] addresses);

event AddressesRemoved(bytes32 indexed node, uint256 cointype, address[] addresses);
```

### Reverse Resolution

This specification is intended to be compatible with existing specifications for reverse resolution, specifically [ENSIP-19](https://docs.ens.domains/ensip/19). As of now, the set of addresses stored in the Addresses field are not to be confused with ["primary"](https://docs.ens.domains/web/reverse) names.
